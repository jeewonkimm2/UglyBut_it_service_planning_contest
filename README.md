# Software Engineering

## Overview
- Goal : The project will consist of proposing a topic for investigation, writing a proposal, writing requirement specification, developing UML diagrams for requirements and design, submitting the documents for requirement specification and design.

- Topic : ‘UglyBut’, a live-commerce software that helps connection between the farmers who worried about handling ugly agricultural product.


### 1. Background
- Ugly agricultural products, which are discarded by 230 tons (about 4 trillion won in production) every year, are classified out of grade by simple external factors such as shape and size and are sold at a bargain price or discarded in South Korea. There are huge social costs and environmental pollution to deal with this. However, the reality is that there is no suitable platform to purchase these agricultural products.

### 2. Expected Effect
1. Consumer demand increases due to accessibility to ugly agricultural products
2. The provision of income sources for farmers whose income is unstable due to fluctuations in agricultural products, etc
3. Providing consumers with reasonable options in response to the rising price era
4. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from food waste and reducing storage/disposal costs of ugly agricultural products
